A simple game of guess the number ranging from 1 - 10. 

The game begins by asking the user to insert a number from 1 - 10. 

Option the user has is to either quit there on the spot which will print the message 

"Goodbye" and quite the process. Alternatively, if the user wants to take part in the game, they would enter a value, and if it's the correct value you will be notified with a simple message congratulating the user. 

Or else they are encouraged to keep guessing until they find the correct answer.  

Hope you enjoy my little project and any feedback will be welcomed. 

 

Yours sincerely Medici.
